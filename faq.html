    <b><i>What is this?</i></b>
    This is a puzzle! Find hidden clues,
    figure out what to do and decipher messages.
    
    <b><i>Is this an ARG?</i></b>
    Compared to other ARGs, this completely lacks any story elements.
    Other than that... I guess.
    
    <b><i>What do I need for this?</i></b>
    It's highly reccomended that you have a PC.
    Some knowledge in cryptography and programming is beneficial.
    
    <b><i>How long will this take me?</i></b>
    I have no idea. Might be a while.
    
    <b><i>Will I get a virus from this?</i></b>
    No you won't. Feel free to decompile and analyze any code.
    Run everything in a VM if you really don't trust me.
    
    <b><i>Help, I set fire to my PC while solving this!</i></b>
    I take zero responsibility for any damage, be it caused by
    overheating or frustration.
    
    <b><i>Where can I get help?</i></b>
    Google probably.
